                    The Ab2d.Controls.ZoomPanel library is the \!ultimate zoom panel\! library for WPF.\n
                    \n
                    The library contains controls that can be used to easily add powerful and animated zooming and panning to you WPF application. With just a few lines of xaml or a few lines of code it is possible to add support for almost every possible zooming scenario.\n
                    \n
                    The following are the main controls in the library:\n
                    \n
                    \*\!ZoomPanel\! - main control that provides zooming and panning of its content\n
                    \*\!ZoomController\! - set zoom factor and navigate\n
                    \*\!ZoomPanelMiniMap\! - shows mini map of ZoomPanel content\n
                    \n
                    The samples show how the controls in the library can be used.\n
                    \n
                    The samples under \!Use cases\! section show some of the most common use cases where ZoomPanel and other controls from the library can be used.\n
                    \n
                    Other samples show various possibilities and customizations of the controls.\n
                    \n
                    And finally you can help make the ultimate zoom control for WPF even better with providing your comments and suggestions on the \!Feedback\! section of the Samples.\n
                    \n
